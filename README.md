### Summary: 
This is a simple recipe app. It fetches a list of recipes from an API and displays them in a list. Tap a recipe to open a menu where you can watch, view, or save the recipe. Saved recipes are stored locally in the app's storage and can be accessed by tapping the bookmark icon on the top right. You can also search for recipes by name or cuisine using the search bar at the top.

### Focus Areas: 
I prioritized performance through efficient requests and caching, as well as user experience by designing a simple and intuitive interface.

### Time Spent: 
I spent around 5-6 hours on this project over the course of two days. I spent the first day tackling the API integration and basically just getting a usable version out, and the second day refining the UI, adding caching, and improving performance.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: 
I think the biggest trade-off I made was focusing on a clean, native-like UI instead of a more complex one because I didn't want to spend too much time on the UI.

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
I don't think there is a weakest part per se, but rather a bunch of small improvements that could be made. Being a mostly self-taught developer, it's a bit hard to know what the best practices are, so parts of my code might not be ideal.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I think this was a really fun project to do, especially since I'm still working on my networking skills.
