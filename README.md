### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
This is a simple recipe app. It fetches a list of recipes from an API and displays them in a list. Tap a recipe to open a menu where you can watch, view, or save the recipe. Saved recipes are stored locally in the app's storage and can be accessed by tapping the bookmark icon on the top right. You can also search for recipes by name or cuisine using the search bar at the top.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritized performance through efficient requests and caching, as well as user experience by designing a simple and intuitive interface.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent around 5-6 hours on this project over the course of two days. I spent the first day tackling the API integration and basically just getting a usable version out, and the second day refining the UI, adding caching, and improving performance.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I think the biggest trade-off I made was focusing on a clean, native-like UI instead of a more complex one because I didn't want to spend too much time on the UI.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I don't think there is a weakest part per se, but rather a bunch of small improvements that could be made. Being a mostly self-taught developer, it's a bit hard to know what the best practices are, so parts of my code might not be ideal.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
